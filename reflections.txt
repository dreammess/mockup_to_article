You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Reflections:

•	What new skills have you learned?

I am able to better identify the task specifications and find the answer using online sources like MDN. I never before had to strike the text through or create a subscript. I was always wondering how one can break the text with the horizontal rule, so finding out about the <hr> was great! 

•	What has been easy?

Everything was quite straight forward and understandable, as I have learned almost everything I needed in the previous quizzes. 

•	What has been difficult?

Understanding the difference between a <a href= and <img src=, but I think I’ve got it now!
 + Finding out what all the needed tags are called is not really hard, but it can take time.

•	How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

I tried not to panic and gave myself time to research! Research always helps!
